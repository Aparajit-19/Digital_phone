<ul>
<li align="left">Developed an application using Java and J2SE to perform simple digital phone operations like storing new contacts, listing them, altering and updating them, and searching for stored contacts.</li>
<li align="left">Implemented Object-Oriented Programming which will provide admin the authority to perform available operations.</li>
<li align="left">To make all operations easier, a user-friendly approach has been taken into account where they have to give inputs during final confirmation to make the operations successful.</li>
<li align="left">To eliminate data redundancy and perform validation processes, background processing will be done which will maintain data intergrity.</li>
